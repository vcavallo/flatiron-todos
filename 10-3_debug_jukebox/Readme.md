You're new on the job and have been given ownership of the company's jukebox application. Unfortunately, before you can even begin adding cool new features to make it much, much more awesome than it is now, you fire it up and it won't even run! Now you have to go through the code and squash all the bugs (there's a bunch!).

Given the following spec, dive into the code and fix one problem at a time until the program's output matches the spec and there are no errors!

to run the program, type `ruby runner.rb`

__Remember!__  
1. read your error messages carefully, check error messages and line numbers  
2. use pry or irb to check your assumptions!  
3. not all bugs will throw errors, check the output against the spec!  
4. your program is only as good as the data you feed it!  
  
When running for the first time, output should be:
